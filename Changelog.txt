* Improves 'direct jump' detection (better compiler change detection in the next version)
* Fixes tmp file issue with IDA 5.7

PatchDiff v2.0.8:

PatchDiff v2.0.7:

* Properly fixes an issue where a int -> to unsigned int would not be detected
* Adds dock support to display graphs (IDA >= 5.6)


PatchDiff v2.0.6:

* Removes invalid C++ classes/structs flagged as functions


PatchDiff v2.0.5:

* Adds string references to the signature
* Fixes IPC close when option is disabled


PatchDiff v2.0.4:

* Requires at least IDA 5.2
* Adds save backup results to IDB
* Adds Unmatch/Set match/Switch match submenus
* Adds "pipe" support to keep second IDA instance open 
  - menu Options/PatchDiff2 to disable/enable it per IDB
  - registry HKLM\SOFTWARE\Tenable\PatchDiff2 IPC (DWORD) for the default setting
* Uses demangled function names
* Ignores duplicated names


PatchDiff v2.0.3:

* Adds support for C++ classes in the signature engine (improves results against c++ targets)
* No longer relies on IDA code refs (due to bad references)
* x86: merges inc reg and dec reg to one instruction
* x86: handles jmp $2/$5
* x86: stops block tracing on int3
* Bugfix: Does not try to display graphs that IDA can't handle


PatchDiff v2.0.2:

* Adds support for IDA 5.1
* Excludes data ref with segment reference from crc
* Adds PPC optimization module
* Relies on IDA to identify opcode for non optimized CPUs
* Adds display graph option for unmatched functions
* Adds x86 rep/repe/repne 16 bit compiler change optimization
* Improves edge double click handling


PatchDiff v2.0.1:

* Increases the size of the command buffer (for long IDB paths)
* Synchronizes graphs on edge double-click
